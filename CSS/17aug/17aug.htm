                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
                technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for its appearance.

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.[2]
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.

                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
